	<h1>Getting the WWW files</h1>
	<p>Read this if you have not yet got the WWW files you need, and you cannot NFS mount a directory on which they
		reside.</p>
	<p>The source and binary of WWW project files are currently available (see copyright ) by anonymous FTP from node
		info.cern.ch. This node is currently 128.141.201.74 but THIS MAY CHANGE. The files are compressed tape archive
		files (.tar.Z). To get a file using anonymous FTP, use user name "anonymous", and your email address as a
		password:-</p>

	<cite>
		> ftp info.cern.ch<br>
		Enter user name: anonymous<br>
		Password: me@myhost.edu<br>
		ftp> cd /pub/www/src<br>
		ftp> binary<br>
		ftp> get WWWLineMode_vvv.tar.Z<br>
		ftp> quit<br>
		><br>
	</cite>

	<p>The file name will depend on the product you want. Here vvv is the version number of the software.</p>
	<p>Once you have the compressed tar file, you must uncompress it and unwrap it.</p>

	<cite>uncompress WWWLineMode_vvv.tar.Z</cite>

	<p>This will make a rather larger file with the name without the ".Z". To unwrap it, tar xvf WWWLineMode_vvv.ta</p>

	<p>Now you should install the line mode browser , install the server , install Viola , etc.</p>
